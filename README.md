macSetup is an ansible playbook to automate macOS installation & configuration:
  * Add users, groups, and shell based on variables defined in [defaults.yml](group_vars_/all/defaults.yml), [host.yml](group_vars_/all/host.yml) and [secrets.yml](group_vars_/secrets.yml)
   * Install all [packages](group_vars_/all/packages.yml) via [homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Mac App Store CLI](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) and downloaded DMG
 * Add printers
 * user preferences
    * activity Monitor
    * dock
    * file type association
    * finder
    * login components
    * photos
    * safari
    * spotlight
    * terminal
    * timeMachine

My objective is to work at the command line and automate so I don't have to document extensively.

## What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

Youâ€™ve been there too â€” setting up a new computer can be an ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming process. Especially if you have a *regular* MacBook, a developper workstation and a Mac Mini acting as your local file server.

I'm not a fan of upgrade or the migration assistant as too much scruff from previously tested applications get carry over. I prefer a clean slate, complexity is the enemy of security.

I wasn't happy with any of the automated setup that I came across. They were either overly complex or were missing features that I really wanted.

## Pre requisites

Ensure that you have identified _all_ the applications on your current Mac:
 * sources such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Mac App Store](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) or a downloaded installation file
 * licensed file and key â€“ some applications require that you uninstall them or deallocate the licence first
 * Backup  your user preferences and settings using the backup playbook

## Installation

I'm currently using [Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/sonoma/), older macOS versions may work.

1. Connect an ethernet adapter to accelerate the files transfer
2. Boot the new Mac and answer a few questions:
    A. Language: English
    B. Country: Canada
    C. Accessibility: _not now_
    D. Migration Assistant: _not now_
3. Sign-in with your apple ID and accept the iCloud Terms & Conditions
4. Create a computer account
5. Install the developer tools (xcode) by opening terminal and typing `git`, the user interface will prompt you to download and install the command line developer tools
6. Clone the macSetup git repository on your Mac `git clone https://github.com/bhdicaire/macSetup` via terminal
7. Install homebrew and the required software components
    1. `cd macSetup`
    2. `make install`
8. Modify the configuration files with a built-in text editor such as `vi`, don't worry the playbook will install [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
    * ./group_vars_/all/defaults.yml
    * ./(group_vars_/all/host.yml
    * ./group_vars_/secrets.yml
    * ./group_vars_/all/packages.yml
11. Go get a cup of coffee because you're NOT done, Vodka is also fine

12. Add and commit your macSetup configuration to a Git repository
13. The following tasks must be performed manually as I have yet to find a way to automate them:
    - [ ] Microsoft Office 2016
    - [ ] App Store - restore In-App Purchases for Marked2
    - [ ] [SetApp](https://setapp.com) applications
      * [Bartender](https://setapp.com/apps/bartender)
      * [Bike](https://setapp.com/apps/bike-outliner)
      * [BusyContact](https://setapp.com/apps/busycontacts)

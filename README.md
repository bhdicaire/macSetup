macSetup is an opinionated playbook to automate macOS installation & configuration:
  * Add users, groups, and shell based on variables defined in [defaults.yml](group_vars/all/defaults.yml), [host.yml](group_vars/all/host.yml) and [secrets.yml](group_vars/secrets.yml)
   * Install all [packages](group_vars/all/packages.yml) via [homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Mac App Store CLI](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) and downloaded DMG
 * Add printers
 * user preferences
    * activity Monitor
    * dock
    * file type association
    * finder
    * login components
    * photos
    * safari
    * spotlight
    * terminal
    * timeMachine

My objective is to work at the command line and automate so I don't have to document extensively.

## What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

Youâ€™ve been there too â€” setting up a new computer can be an ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming process. Especially if you have a *regular* MacBook, a developper workstation and a Mac Mini acting as your local file server.

I wasn't happy with any of the automated setup that I came across. They were either overly complex or were missing features that I really wanted.

I'm not a fan of upgrade or the migration assistant as too much scruff from previously tested applications get carry over. I prefer a clean slate, complexity is the enemy of security.

## Installation

Ensure that you have identified _all_ the applications on your current Mac:
 * Download page or source such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh) or the [Mac App Store](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
 * License key or file â€“ some applications require that you uninstall them or deallocate the licence first
 * Backup your user preferences and settings using the backup playbook

I'm currently using [Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/sonoma/), older macOS versions _may_ work:

1. Connect an ethernet adapter to accelerate files transfer
2. Boot the new Mac and answer a few questions:
    1. Language: English
    1. Country: Canada
    1. Accessibility: _not now_
    1. Migration Assistant: _not now_
3. Sign-in with your apple ID and accept the Terms & Conditions
4. Create a computer account
5. Install the developer tools (xcode) by opening terminal and typing `git`, the user interface will prompt you and then download and install the command line developer tools
6. Clone the macSetup git repository on your Mac via terminal
    1. `git clone https://github.com/bhdicaire/macSetup`
7. Install the required software components run the Ansible playbook
    1. `cd macSetup`
    2. `make install`
8. Modify the configuration files with a built-in text editor such as `vi`:
    * ./group_vars/all/defaults.yml
    * ./(group_vars/all/host.yml
    * ./group_vars/secrets.yml
    * ./group_vars/all/packages.yml
9. Run the Ansible playbook provision.yml
    1. `make build`
    1. Go get a cup of coffee because you're NOT done, Vodka is also fine
10. Add and commit your macSetup configuration to a Git repository
11. The following tasks must be performed manually as I have yet to find a way to automate them:
    - [ ] Microsoft Office 2016
    - [ ] App Store - restore In-App Purchases for Marked2
    - [ ] [SetApp](https://setapp.com) applications
